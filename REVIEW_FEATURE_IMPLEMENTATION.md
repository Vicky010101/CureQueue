# Patient Review Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Implemented an automatic patient review system that triggers when a doctor marks an appointment as "Completed". The review modal appears automatically in the patient's dashboard, allowing them to rate their experience with 1-5 stars and optionally add a comment.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Review Model (`backend/models/Review.js`)
- Added support for appointment-based reviews
- New fields:
  - `patientId`: Reference to User (patient)
  - `doctorId`: Reference to User (doctor)
  - `appointmentId`: Reference to Appointment
  - `rating`: 1-5 star rating
- Added compound index on `{appointmentId, userId}` to prevent duplicate reviews
- Maintained backward compatibility with facility reviews

#### 2. Reviews API (`backend/routes/reviews.js`)
- **New Endpoint: POST `/api/reviews/add`**
  - Accepts: `appointmentId`, `doctorId`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Validates rating (1-5)
  - Prevents duplicate reviews
  - Returns success message and review data
  - Protected by auth middleware

#### 3. Appointments API (`backend/routes/appointments.js`)
- Updated `GET /appointments/me` endpoint
- Now returns `doctorId` field for each appointment
- Added `_id` field alongside `id` for consistency

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. New Component: ReviewModal (`frontend/src/components/ReviewModal.js`)
- Beautiful modal with teal healthcare theme
- Interactive 5-star rating system with hover effects
- Optional comment textarea (500 character limit)
- Real-time character counter
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Loading state during submission
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Fully responsive (mobile-friendly)

#### 2. ReviewModal Styling (`frontend/src/components/ReviewModal.css`)
- Professional healthcare design
- Semi-transparent overlay (#00000080)
- White modal card with 16px border radius
- Teal (#0f766e) accent colors for active states
- Hover effects and transitions
- Mobile-responsive breakpoints
- Loading spinner animation

#### 3. DoctorDashboard Updates (`frontend/src/pages/DoctorDashboard.js`)
- Modified `completeAppointment` function
- Now emits `appointmentUpdated` event with:
  - `_id`: appointment ID
  - `status`: 'completed'
  - `doctorId`: doctor's user ID
- No changes to existing appointment completion logic

#### 4. PatientDashboard Updates (`frontend/src/pages/PatientDashboard.js`)
- Added state management for review modal:
  - `showReviewModal`: Boolean to control modal visibility
  - `reviewAppointment`: Stores appointment data for review
  - `reviewedAppointments`: Set to track already reviewed appointments
- Store `doctorId` when loading appointments
- Listen for `appointmentUpdated` events
- Automatically show review modal when:
  - Appointment status changes to 'completed'
  - Appointment hasn't been reviewed yet
- Render ReviewModal component
- Handle modal close and mark reviewed appointments

## User Flow

1. **Doctor completes appointment**
   - Doctor clicks "Complete" button in DoctorDashboard
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Appointment status updates to "completed"
   - Event is emitted via queueBus

2. **Patient receives notification**
   - PatientDashboard listens for `appointmentUpdated` event
   - Detects status = "completed"
   - Checks if appointment hasn't been reviewed
   - Automatically shows ReviewModal

3. **Patient submits review**
   - Modal displays: "Rate Your Experience with Dr. [Name]"
   - Patient clicks 1-5 stars (required)
   - Patient can optionally add comment
   - Patient clicks "Submit Review"
   - Review is saved to MongoDB reviews collection
   - Success toast: "Thank you for your feedback!"
   - Modal closes automatically
   - Appointment is marked as reviewed (won't show modal again)

4. **Duplicate prevention**
   - Frontend tracks reviewed appointments in Set
   - Backend enforces unique constraint on {appointmentId, userId}
   - Patient cannot review same appointment twice

## Technical Features

### Real-time Communication
- Uses existing `queueBus` event system
- No additional WebSocket dependencies
- Events: `appointmentUpdated`

### Data Storage
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,        // Patient who wrote review
  patientId: ObjectId,     // Same as userId
  appointmentId: ObjectId, // Specific appointment
  doctorId: ObjectId,      // Doctor being reviewed
  rating: Number,          // 1-5 stars
  stars: Number,           // Duplicate for compatibility
  comment: String,         // Optional feedback
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Security
